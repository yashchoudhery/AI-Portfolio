Experience

Post-Graduate Researcher, Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence, IIIT-Delhi  (Jan,25 -Present)
Designed and implemented a privacy-preserving Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) framework for speech tasks (Keyword Spotting & Speaker Verification), enabling multi-party collaboration without sharing raw audio data. Proposed novel speech-specific feature partitioning strategies – Multi-Band Spectrogram Splitting (frequency domain) and Temporal Sound Shredding (time domain) – achieving strong privacy guarantees while retaining discriminative cues. Benchmarked multiple state-of-the-art models in the VFL setting (MatchBoxNet, BC-ResNet for KWS; ECAPA-TDNN, RawNet-3 for SV) and achieved 92.4% KWS accuracy and 3.79% SV EER, comparable to centralized baselines. Evaluated homogeneous vs heterogeneous client architectures, uncovering key challenges in gradient alignment, feature integration, and embedding stability across distributed clients. Conducted large-scale experiments on SpeechCommands-V2 (105K audio clips) and VoxCeleb2 (1M utterances), simulating real-world deployment conditions with heterogeneous models and varied splitting strategies. Performed representation analysis (t-SNE) and convergence studies, highlighting stability differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous federated setups.

Vertical Federated Learning for Keyword Spotting & Speaker Verification.
Guide: Dr. Vinayak Abrol


(Jan,25 – Present)


Designed and implemented a privacy-preserving Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) framework for speech tasks, enabling multi-party training without raw audio sharing. Proposed speech-optimised feature partitioning (Multi-Band Spectrogram Splitting, Temporal Sound Shredding), boosting privacy while retaining task-relevant cues. Benchmarked SOTA models (MatchBoxNet, BC-ResNet for KWS; ECAPA-TDNN, RawNet-3 for SV) under homogeneous and heterogeneous client setups, achieving 92.4% KWS accuracy and 3.79% SV EER, comparable to centralized baselines. Conducted large-scale experiments on SpeechCommands-V2 (105K clips) and VoxCeleb2 (1M utterances), simulating real-world federated deployment with distributed architectures.

Single Object Tracking
Guide: Dr. Vinayak Abrol
(Aug,24 – Dec,24)
Team Size: 4
Delivered a real-time object tracker with camera-motion compensation using ORB-based affine alignment, sustaining 30 FPS on 1080p video streams. Integrated multi-scale search windows and hybrid descriptors (HOG, LBP, SIFT, ORB), boosting robustness against variations in shape, texture, and scale. Applied ensemble regressors (Linear Regression, Random Forest) for centroid and bounding-box prediction, achieving 85% IoU, R² = 0.92, and reducing MAE by 20%. Owned the end-to-end delivery cycle: dataset curation, hyper-parameter sweeps, performance profiling, Git-based code reviews, deployment, and post-release support.
